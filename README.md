## Motivation
I wanted to use new technologies currently going on for Single Page Applications. There are many
Twitter clones out there, and there are many NextJS apps out there, but what makes this project
different is that it is production ready, fast, and easily deployable. A full scale app that anyone can deploy so they can spin up their own social media.
